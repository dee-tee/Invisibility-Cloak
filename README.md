# Mr. India
If you are an Indian, by now you probably would have an idea what is this about.
If you are not, I have some more names-"Invisibility Cloak", "Translucent(The Boys)","The Invisible Man","Hollow Man".
All of us have enjoyed invisibility-themed movies and wondered at somepoint what would it feel like and all sorts of things that we would do if we had that superpower.
This repository contains the code to this very trickery, that is, you can become invisible.
# Technology Stack
 I have written the code in Python using OpenCV and numpy libraries.
# How does the Code Work
When you run the code two windows will open up, one containing the trackbars for adjusting the Hue, Saturation and Value to tweak the colour to the garment you are wearing or the colour of the cloak that you will use, the other window contains the livestream, adjust the values based on what you are wearing and watch the magic unfold.
